# There have some projects using Java
### 1. [Khoj The Search](https://github.com/ImranHossain00/Simple-Projects-with-JAVA/tree/main/Khoj_The_Search/Khoj-The-Search)
This simple project is a system where users can create accounts with unique usernames
and passwords, log in, and access a home page. On the home page, users can input
integer values and set search criteria. A "Khoj" button allows them 
to initiate a search to determine if the specified values exist in 
the provided input. The system utilizes a REST API to display input values
associated with a specific ID number within a defined time range. The
API responds with a JSON object containing the relevant information.

### 2. [Taka-Poisa](https://github.com/ImranHossainFakir/Simple-Projects-with-JAVA/tree/main/Taka-Poisa)
This Project is currently in development.
